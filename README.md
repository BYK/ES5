# ES5
es5.js is a separate, standalone and unobtrusive library that gives the new [ECMAScript 5](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) functions such as `Array.prototype.map` to all browsers.
It does not override any previously defined function so that you use the native implementation in the browser when available.

The functions in the project are derived from various sources like the public [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/) recommendations, [Google V8](http://code.google.com/p/v8/)'s source code or [Douglas Crockford](http://www.crockford.com/)'s [json2.js](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) library or written by the project authors themselves.
