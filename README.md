# ES5
es5.js is a separate, standalone and unobtrusive library that gives the new ES5 functions such as Array.prototype.map to all browsers.
It does not override any previously defined function so that you use the native implementation in the browser when available.

The functions in the project are derived from various source like the public Mozilla Developer Center recommendations, Google V8 Project's source code or Douglas Crockford's json2.js library or written by the project authors themselves.
